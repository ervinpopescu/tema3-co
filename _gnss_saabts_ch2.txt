                               measurements. It has been applied in many ﬁelds, including speech enhancement [14],
                               magnetic resonance imaging [15], wireless sensor network [16], etc. Moreover, several
                               CS-basedmethodshavebeenproposedforGNSSsignalacquisition. Heetal.[17]usedthe
                               sparse matrix to compress the spread spectrum signal and reconstructed the compressed
                               signal based on the greedy algorithm. Kong et al. [18] proposed two-stage compression
                               of GNSS signal by the Walsh–Hadamard matrix, which achieved fast acquisition with
                               fewer correlators than traditional acquisition methods. Chang et al. [19] combined CS
                               with subspace to enhance the acquisition performance of GNSS signal when there are a
                               lot of interferences. He et al. [20] designed a sparse dictionary based on the features of the

                               fast acquisition. However, the above algorithms are based on the conventional frequency

                               highdynamicconditions.
                                   In this paper, a GNSS signal acquisition algorithm based on two-stage compression
                               of the code-frequency domain is proposed, which divides the Doppler frequency offset
                               into multiple intervals, and the multiple frequency points are compressed and searched
                               in every interval at the same time to increase the correlation bandwidth. This method can
                               overcomethelimitations of the conventional Doppler frequency search and is suitable for
                               fast acquisition in high dynamics.
                                   The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the compres-
                               sion acquisition theory and the problems of the compression acquisition algorithm in a
                               highly dynamic environment. Section 3 proposes the model of two-stage compression and
                               theoretically analyzes the advantages of the proposed method, including computational
                               complexity and detection probability. Section 4 compares the performance of the proposed
                               algorithm with other acquisition algorithms and discusses the performance with different
                               keyparameters. Section 5 concludes this paper.
